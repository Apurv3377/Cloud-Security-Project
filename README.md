1.Flush and Reload Function

The FLUSH+RELOAD technique is a variant of PRIME+PROBE that relies on sharing pages between the spy and the victim processes. With shared pages, the spy can ensure that a specific memory line is evicted from the whole cache hierarchy. The spy uses this to monitor access to the memory line.           
A round of attack consists of three phases. During the first phase, the monitored memory line is flushed from the cache hierarchy. The spy, then, waits to allow the victim time to access the memory line before the third phase. In the third phase, the spy reloads the memory line, measuring the time to load it. If during the wait phase the victim accesses the memory line, the line will be available in the cache and the reload operation will take a short time. If, on the other hand, the victim has not accessed the memory line, the line will need to be brought from memory and the reload will take significantly longer. Figure 3 (A) and (B) show the timing of the attack phases without and with victim access. As shown in Fig. 3 (C), the victim access can overlap the reload phase of the spy. In such a case, the victim access will not trigger a cache fill. Instead, the victim will use the cached data from the reload phase. Consequently,
the spy will miss the access.                       
A similar scenario is when the reload operation partially overlaps the victim access. In this case, depicted in Fig. 3 (D), the reload phase starts while the victim is waiting for the data. The reload benefits from the victim access and terminates faster than if the data has to be loaded from memory. However, the timing may still be longer than a load from the cache. As the victim access is independent of the execution of the spy process code, increasing the wait period reduces the probability of missing the access due to an overlap. On the other hand, increasing the wait period reduces the granularity of the attack. One way to improve the resolution of the attack without increasing the error rate is to target memory accesses that occur frequently, such as a loop body. The attack will not be able to discern between separate accesses, but, as Fig. 3 (E) shows, the likelihood of missing the loop is small.                    
Several processor optimisations may result in false positives due to speculative memory accesses issued by the victim’s processor. These optimisations include data prefetching to exploit spatial locality and speculative execution. When analysing the attack results, the attacker must be aware of these optimisations and develop strategies to filter them.
